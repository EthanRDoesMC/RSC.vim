# RSC.vim
Syntax highlighting for the RSC

![Preview](https://github.com/EthanRDoesMC/RSC.vim/blob/b609b2b3b1c05238546a09e96b58d0727dfa04ab/RSCvim%20preview.jpg)

(The colorscheme in this screenshot is [kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim).)

## Installation
Same as always. vim-plug for example:
```vim
Plug 'EthanRDoesMC/RSC.vim'
```

You'll need to run `set ft=rsc` when you want to use the highlighting. This is because loading RSC syntax by default for all text files is not a good idea.
